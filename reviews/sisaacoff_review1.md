# Million Song Dataset (*Sally Isaacoff*)

### Strengths
- Really cool data set.  Great job leveraging python to wrangle it all into one folder and parse it into a usable format.
- The orgnization made it easy to work through your analysis
- Large variety of visualizations

### Improvements
- There's a lot to digest.  It'd be interesting if you narrowed the scope and dug deeper into one aspect, which it looks like you will be doing for the next project.

### Code
- Again, really impressed with the amount of python needed to get this into a data frame.  Thanks for explaining it step-by-step.

### Questions
- Too bad about the missing years--they were more than half of the observations.  Was there anything else that might indicate when they were made?

### Next Steps
- One question that jumps out instantly to me is if there is any correlation between particular words and the popularity of a song/artist.
