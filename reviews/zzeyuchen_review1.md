# NYC Restaurant Inspection Data Analysis (*Zach Zeyuchen*)

### Strengths
- Interesting and relevant data set.
- Thanks for the context on the grading system.  It definitely helped frame your analysis.
- Converting the points to a 100 scale was a clever way to turn this data into something more recognizable.

### Improvements
- Think about how you can improve the narrative structure.  There is a lot of interesting data and findings.  However, it's sometimes hard to keep track of where I am in your thought process.  Try making more use of markdown cells instead of code comments to tell your story.

### Code
- Awesome usage of .apply() to clean up the cuisine column.  It's odd that there's not a more standardized way for them to record this--must not be a priority data point for the health department.

### Next Steps
- I'd definitely like to see the map you come up with.  I'm wondering if there is any bias for particular locations.
- Include the specific violation codes next time.  That might uncover some nuances that weren't apparent in your analysis, such as differences between the bouroughs.
