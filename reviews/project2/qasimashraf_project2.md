# Predicting NYC 311 complaints
*Qasim Ashraf*

## Strengths
- Really cool and practical project idea
- Great visualizations of call volume by department.  Also, the lat/long scatterplot was great.

## Improvements
- Lot of gory details with the confusion matrices.  I lost sight of your analysis among all the data and charts.
- Not a lot of context or explanation givent toward the bottom.  Consider breaking up your analysis steps.

## Questions
- What actually happens during a 311 call?  Is there any routing ("Press 1 for..."), or is it just an operator?  That might have some bearing on how they get routed initially.
- Where did you get the $3.42 per call stat?

## Code
- well commented and organized
- you made good use of `for` loops and functions

## Next Steps
- Simplify! :)  It'll be easier to solve a series of discrete problems thank one monolitihic problem.
