# Supervised Learning: Yelp Reviews
*Zach Zeyuchen*

## Strengths
- Clear statement of purpose and overview of data set and files used
- Random sampling of the dataset to make it more manageaable
- Workflow was very easy to follow along

## Improvements
- The JSON-to-CSV process sounded really interesting!  You should have included it.
- An ROC curve would have been better to visualize the AUC score than a KDE plot

## Code
- Great use of numpy to randomly choose index values for your sample set.  I wasn't aware of that feature.
- Recurring use of .shape to keep an eye on the size of your dataset after cleanup tasks

## Next Steps
- I wonder if you can use number of useful votes to give more weight to a specific observation instead of an additional feature.
