# Regression

*A technique for predicting a continuous numerical outcome.*

A regression takes a set of dependent variables that are associated with an independent variable of known value and creates a predictive model based on the data.  An effective regression model will closely predict the target value using any valid input values.

**Examples**
- A student's end-of-year average based on their attendance.
- Predicting proficiency on a state test based on their results from an alternative assessment.
- Predicting the likelyhood that a student will be retained ("held back") at the end of the year based on their performance earlier in the year.
